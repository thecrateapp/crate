# React Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for React applications. Contains 70 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new React components
- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                  | Impact      | Prefix       |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Eliminating Waterfalls    | CRITICAL    | `async-`     |
| 2        | Bundle Size Optimization  | CRITICAL    | `bundle-`    |
| 3        | Server-Side Performance   | HIGH        | `server-`    |
| 4        | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH | `client-`    |
| 5        | Re-render Optimization    | MEDIUM      | `rerender-`  |
| 6        | Rendering Performance     | MEDIUM      | `rendering-` |
| 7        | JavaScript Performance    | LOW-MEDIUM  | `js-`        |
| 8        | Advanced Patterns         | LOW         | `advanced-`  |

## Key Rules (most relevant to this project)

### Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)

- `async-parallel` - Use Promise.all() for independent operations
- `async-defer-await` - Move await into branches where actually used
- `async-suspense-boundaries` - Use Suspense to stream content

### Bundle Size (CRITICAL)

- `bundle-barrel-imports` - Import directly, avoid barrel files
- `bundle-dynamic-imports` - Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- `bundle-defer-third-party` - Load analytics/logging after hydration

### Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)

- `rerender-memo` - Extract expensive work into memoized components
- `rerender-derived-state-no-effect` - Derive state during render, not effects
- `rerender-no-inline-components` - Don't define components inside components
- `rerender-functional-setstate` - Use functional setState for stable callbacks

### Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)

- `rendering-conditional-render` - Use ternary, not && for conditionals
- `rendering-content-visibility` - Use content-visibility for long lists
