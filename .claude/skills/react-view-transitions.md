description: Guide for implementing smooth animations using React's View Transition API. Use when adding page transitions, animating route changes, creating shared element animations, animating enter/exit of components, animating list reorder, or implementing directional navigation animations. Triggers on mentions of view transitions, ViewTransition, transition types, or animating between UI states.

# React View Transitions

Animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition`. Declare _what_ with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger _when_ with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, control _how_ with CSS classes.

## When to Apply

- Adding page/route transitions
- Shared element animations (list -> detail)
- Enter/exit animations for conditional content
- List reorder animations
- Suspense fallback-to-content reveals

## Key Concepts

- `<ViewTransition>` auto-assigns `view-transition-name` and calls `document.startViewTransition`
- Only `startTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or `Suspense` activate VTs (not regular setState)
- Use `default="none"` liberally to prevent unwanted cross-fades
- Same `name` on two VTs creates shared element morph
- `addTransitionType` tags transitions for directional animations

## Animation Priority

| Priority | Pattern                        | What it communicates             |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1        | Shared element (`name`)        | "Same thing - going deeper"      |
| 2        | Suspense reveal                | "Data loaded"                    |
| 3        | List identity (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement"    |
| 4        | State change (`enter`/`exit`)  | "Something appeared/disappeared" |
| 5        | Route change (layout-level)    | "Going to a new place"           |
