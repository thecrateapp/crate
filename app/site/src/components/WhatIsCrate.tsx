          Crate runs on a server you control. Point it at a music folder and it
          helps you browse, clean up, understand, and listen to that collection
          from the web or your phone.

            Admin is for looking after the library: imports, repairs, metadata,
            analysis, health, users, and background work. It is intentionally
            more operational.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listen is for playing music. It should feel quieter and more direct,
            because nobody wants to think about worker queues when they are just
            choosing an album.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underneath that, Crate uses a database, Redis, background workers,
            and a few native helpers. It is more demanding than a tiny music
            server because it is doing more than serving files, and that
            tradeoff is part of the project.
