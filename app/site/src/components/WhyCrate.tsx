      After trying several excellent self-hosted tools, I discovered projects
      like <strong className="font-semibold text-white/82">Navidrome</strong> —
      outstanding software that is lightweight, elegant, and thoughtfully
      designed. It reminded me that self-hosted music could be pleasant, not
      just possible.
    </>,
    "It also showed me what I personally missed: more context, more discovery, and better tools for taking care of a collection that had taken years to build.",
  ],
  [
    "The idea stayed around. It kept coming back between work, parenthood, and the usual tiredness of adult life. At the same time, the way I build software changed: less solo typing, more planning, reviewing, and directing AI agents through concrete work.",
    <>
      Eventually, the obvious question arose:{" "}
      <strong className="font-semibold text-white/86">
        If this way of building actually works, could I use it to make the music
        tool I kept wishing existed?

  [
    "Crate is built around a simple frustration: music tools often ask you to give up too much. Your files, your habits, your discovery, your relationship with artists. I wanted something that kept more of that close.",
    "It is being built in a slightly unusual way, with a lot of planning and a lot of AI-assisted implementation. That does not make the work magic. It still needs taste, review, testing, and people willing to say when something feels wrong.",
    "The project is early. Some parts are already useful, some are rough, and some are still ideas. That is the honest state of it.",

      <strong className="font-semibold text-white/86">
        I’m looking for developers, self-hosters, and music people
      </strong>{" "}
      who are willing to try it, question it, and help shape it. Strong opinions
      are useful here.
    </>,
    "If you care about self-hosted music, own-your-data tools, Go, React, TypeScript, Docker, or just the idea of taking back control of a music collection, you can help.",
    "Try it, break it, criticize it, suggest something better, or build a piece of it.",
