        <p>
          A while ago, I stopped feeling comfortable using the major streaming
          platforms. At first it was just a vague discomfort, the feeling that
          something no longer fit. Over time, it became painfully clear: the
          treatment of artists, the ruthless extraction logic, and business
          decisions that couldn't be separated from their political and cultural
          consequences. All of it piled up until the question was no longer
          "which service do I use?" but "what kind of system am I feeding?"
        </p>

        <p className="text-[18px] font-medium leading-[1.7] text-white/85">
          Music has always meant everything to me. Not as background noise, not
          as functional ambience, not as another algorithm-driven playlist
          trying to keep me hooked for five more minutes. Music is discovery,
          context, obsession, memory, identity, and community.
        </p>

        <p>
          It became harder and harder to reconcile that deep relationship with
          platforms that turn music into a supply chain optimized for attention
          capture and corporate profit.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-10 border-white/8" />

        <p>
          The system isn't broken — it's working exactly as designed. Designed
          to extract value from artists and redistribute it upward. An
          independent musician needs hundreds of thousands of streams to earn
          what a single concert ticket costs. Fractions of a cent per play while
          the platforms hand billions to shareholders. The pro-rata model is a
          legal scam: your listens subsidize major label hits and executive
          bonuses.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Spotify is the largest extractor.</b> It pays artists less per
          stream than any competitor while spending billions on podcast
          exclusivity, stock buybacks, and military AI contracts. Apple Music
          and Amazon Music are loss leaders designed to sell hardware and Prime
          subscriptions — music is the bait, not the product. YouTube Music
          monetizes your attention and serves ads on independent artists' work
          without asking. These are not music companies. They are extraction
          companies that happen to sell access to music.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[18px] font-medium leading-[1.7] text-white/85">
          In a system like this, piracy is not theft. It's self-defense.
        </p>

        <p>
          But let's be clear about what that means. This is not a call to stop
          paying artists. It's a call to stop paying middlemen. Pirate the
          catalog that the labels hold hostage — the music that already made its
          money ten times over. Then spend every cent you save on concert
          tickets, Bandcamp purchases, merch tables, and direct support. Pirate
          from the corporation. Pay the artist. The two acts belong together.
        </p>

        <p>
          The real theft happens every day, in plain sight, with terms of
          service and quarterly earnings reports. It happens when a platform
          pays an artist $0.003 per stream and calls it "democratizing music."
          It happens when algorithms bury the work of independent musicians
          under an endless sea of AI-generated filler and major-label playlist
          placements. It happens when the entire relationship between a listener
          and a musician is mediated by a corporation whose only incentive is to
          keep you scrolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why more and more artists are saying <b>enough</b>. Massive
          Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Godspeed You! Black Emperor,
          and others have pulled their music from Spotify — not just over the
          miserable payouts, but because they refuse to let their listeners'
          money fund a model that destroys culture and invests in military AI
          tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          The math is public. An artist with forty thousand monthly listeners on
          Spotify earns roughly a hundred dollars a month from streams. On
          Bandcamp Friday, selling thirty albums at ten dollars each puts two
          hundred and seventy dollars directly in the artist's hands. Same
          audience, thirty times the income. The platforms know this math.
          They're counting on you not doing it.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-10 border-white/8" />

        <p>
          This is bigger than music. It's the same logic that turns housing into
          investment vehicles, food delivery into gig exploitation, and personal
          data into surveillance products. The streaming economy is not an
          accident — it's a pattern. Platforms own the pipes, extract the value,
          and leave creators with scraps while calling it opportunity. Your
          listening history is not neutral. It's a commodity. Every skip, every
          repeat, every 3 AM playlist builds a profile that is bought and sold.
          With Crate, that data stays on your server. No corporation builds a
          profile on your taste. No algorithm nudges you toward whatever pays
          the highest royalty. Your attention is not the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          So yes: download the music. Build your library. Own your files. And
          then take the money you would have given to a streaming platform and
          spend it where it actually matters.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[18px] font-medium leading-[1.7] text-white/85">
          Buy the concert ticket. Buy the record at the merch table. Buy the
          t-shirt. Send the band a message telling them their album changed your
          week. Show up. That is how you support music. That is how you keep
          music alive. Not by adding another passive stream to a pool that pays
          artists less than minimum wage.

        <p>
          This is not just a complaint. It is a call to reclaim what belongs to
          us. Music is not content. It is culture. And culture should not be
          rented.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is also not a solo project. It's a bet that small groups of
          people — friends, collectives, local scenes, people who will still be
          self-hosting things in ten years — can build their own infrastructure.
          Run a Crate instance for your community. Host a listening party. Share
          your library with your housemates. The goal isn't to replace Spotify
          with another monolith. It's to make the monolith irrelevant, one
          community server at a time.
