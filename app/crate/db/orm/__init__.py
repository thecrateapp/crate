"""SQLAlchemy ORM-mapped table models for Crate.

These are the tables that benefit from ORM treatment — simple CRUD
domains where relationships, identity tracking, and typed access

Complex query domains (analytics, browse, bliss, tasks claiming with
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) stay on Core / ``text()`` in ``db/queries/``
and ``db/jobs/``. See the refactor plan for the rationale.
