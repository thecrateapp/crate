"""Baseline schema for Alembic-managed installs.

This revision now creates the full pre-Alembic baseline directly, so fresh
installs can be provisioned by Alembic alone. Later Alembic revisions
(``002+``) layer newer tables/columns on top.

Legacy in-app migrations are kept only as an optional compatibility bridge for
old private installs; they are no longer the normal runtime bootstrap path.
