"""Explicit transaction boundaries for the Crate data layer.

``transaction_scope()`` is the canonical way for runtime code to talk
to PostgreSQL. It yields a SQLAlchemy ``Session`` with automatic
commit/rollback semantics:

    with transaction_scope() as session:
        session.execute(text("INSERT INTO ..."), {...})
        # auto-committed here

Legacy psycopg2 bootstrap still lives in ``db.core``, but this module
no longer exposes a cursor-based compatibility wrapper. New runtime
code should always compose around ``Session``.
