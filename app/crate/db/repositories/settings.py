"""Settings repository — the first ORM-backed repository in Crate.

Replaces the raw-SQL ``get_setting`` / ``set_setting`` functions with
typed Session-based operations. The pattern established here applies
to every future repository:

  1. Functions accept a ``Session`` (from ``transaction_scope()``).
  2. They return Pydantic models (from ``db/models/``), not dicts.
  3. Writes go through the ORM model (from ``db/orm/``).
  4. The caller controls the transaction boundary.

For backward compatibility, each function also works standalone
(opens its own session if none is passed). This lets us migrate
callers one by one without a big bang.
