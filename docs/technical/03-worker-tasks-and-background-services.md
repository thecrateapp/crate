# Worker, Tasks, and Background Services

## Why the worker exists

Crate's worker layer is not just “background jobs”. It is the write-capable
side of the system and is split into several production containers so heavy
work cannot starve playback or interactive admin/listen traffic.

Anything that can mutate the library or perform long-running work belongs here:

- downloads
- Bandcamp collection sync and purchase imports
- file moves
- tag writes
- image writes
- user upload normalization and contribution withdrawal
- scans and repairs
- enrichment fan-out
- storage migration
- audio analysis orchestration
- snapshot projection

The worker mounts `/music` read-write, unlike the API.

## Execution model

The Python worker entrypoint is `app/crate/worker.py`, but production does not
run every concern inside a single container anymore.

Current production split:

- `crate-worker`: `fast,default` queues, service loop, scheduler, watcher,
  imports, cleanup, Telegram, and write-capable general work.
- `crate-maintenance-worker`: `maintenance` queue for repair/sync/enrichment
  style work that can be deferred.
- `crate-analysis-worker`: `heavy` queue for CPU/DSP-heavy analysis,
  fingerprints, and bliss work.
- `crate-playback-worker`: `playback` queue for playback prepare and
  transcoding work with its own ffmpeg/thread limits.
- `crate-projector`: dedicated `projector` command consuming domain events and
  warming snapshots.
- `crate-media-worker`: Rust service used by API/worker paths for package
  generation, download artifacts, Redis progress, cancellation, and slot
  admission.

All Python worker containers initialize the DB/runtime they need, but flags such
as `--no-service-loop`, `--no-daemons`, `--no-projector`, and queue selection
keep each runtime narrowly scoped.

## Task model

Crate tasks are dual-represented:

- PostgreSQL row in `tasks`
- Dramatiq message delivered to an actor

### Why both exist

The DB row provides:

- a stable task id
- persistent status and progress
- cancellation
- task history in the UI
- a place to attach result and error payloads

The Dramatiq message provides:

- asynchronous execution
- queueing
- retries
- process isolation
- distribution over worker processes

This remains one of the most important architectural choices in the project.

## Task lifecycle

### Creation

`create_task()` / `create_task_dedup()`:

- insert a row into `tasks`
- derive queue/priority/runtime limits from config
- schedule Dramatiq dispatch only after the surrounding transaction commits
- can participate in a caller-owned session

### Execution

The actor wrapper in `app/crate/actors.py`:

- fetches the task row
- acquires Redis-backed locks/semaphores when needed
- marks the task as running
- starts heartbeat state
- calls the real handler
- records completion or failure
- releases locks

### Progress and events

- coarse progress lives on `tasks.progress`
- richer task activity lives in `task_events`
- SSE endpoints stream both global and per-task activity

### Cancellation

Cancellation is cooperative:

- the task row can be marked cancelled
- handlers poll for cancellation
- Crate does not kill threads preemptively during filesystem work

## Not all follow-up work is a DB task

The task model is important, but it is not the only async mechanism anymore.

Examples:

- the **projector** consumes Redis Stream domain events in its own loop
- **scrobble follow-ups** for play events are queued as direct actors after
  commit rather than as user-visible task rows
- **analysis/bliss daemons** claim pipeline work directly rather than routing
  every unit of work through a task row

That split is intentional: not every async unit needs to be operator-visible as
its own row in `tasks`.

## Queue and priority strategy

`app/crate/actors.py` defines per-task execution policy.

Queues:

- `fast` — lightweight HTTP/DB-heavy but short jobs
- `default` — mixed work, library pipeline, downloads, management
- `maintenance` — repair, sync, enrichment and other deferrable maintenance
- `heavy` — reserved for heavier CPU paths
- `playback` — playback preparation and transcode jobs

Bandcamp work is split by cost and risk:

- `bandcamp_sync_collection` runs on `maintenance` and records collection,
  wishlist, following, match candidates, and Radar entries.
- `bandcamp_import_purchase` runs on `default`, downloads an owned purchase into
  staging, reuses the upload/import path, records contribution provenance, and
  skips content that already exists in the shared library.
- `bandcamp_radar_refresh` runs on `fast`.
- contribution withdrawal/cleanup runs on `default` because it can delete
  library files when no other active contributor remains.

Priority bands broadly map to:

- urgent user actions
- immediate post-ingest work
- scheduled operational work
- lower-priority maintenance/backfills

## Coordination primitives

### Resource governor and maintenance window

`app/crate/resource_governor.py` protects interactive playback/API usage from
expensive background work. Governed tasks can be deferred based on:

- one-minute load ratio
- sampled iowait
- swap and available memory pressure
- active listeners and recent streams
- configured maintenance windows for destructive or heavy maintenance flows

The main knobs are `CRATE_RESOURCE_*` and `CRATE_MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_*`. Manual
or narrowly scoped tasks can bypass parts of this protection only when the task
type explicitly allows it.

### DB-heavy mutex

Some tasks should not overlap, especially ones that churn library state:

- `library_sync`
- `library_pipeline`
- `wipe_library`
- `rebuild_library`
- `repair`
- `migrate_storage_v2`

These use Redis-backed coordination so only one runs at a time across worker
processes.

### Download semaphore

Tidal, Soulseek, and Bandcamp import transfers are globally capped using a
Redis semaphore.

## Service loop responsibilities

`_run_service_loop()` is the second major part of the worker runtime.

On a cadence, it handles:

- filesystem watcher lifecycle
- scheduled task creation
- import queue refresh
- zombie task cleanup
- worker status cache updates
- ops runtime state updates
- queue depth metrics
- metrics flush to PostgreSQL
- incremental shadow read-model backfill for analysis/bliss pipeline tables
- old task/event/log/session/jam cleanup

This is what makes the worker feel like a living background runtime rather than
a pure broker consumer.

## Filesystem watcher

`app/crate/library_watcher.py` uses `watchdog` to:

- react to created and moved audio files
- debounce per album directory
- ignore files written by enrichment or artwork generation
- avoid infinite loops using runtime flags and suppression logic

Watcher events trigger sync and downstream processing rather than performing
heavy work inline.

## Scheduler

`app/crate/scheduler.py` implements configurable recurring tasks backed by
settings rather than static cron files.

Default schedules cover things such as:

- artist enrichment
- library pipeline
- analytics
- new releases
- incomplete download cleanup
- show sync

It checks both elapsed time and whether a same-type task is already
pending/running to avoid schedule storms.

## Analysis and bliss daemons

Separate long-lived daemons handle throughput-oriented analysis flows:

- audio analysis daemon
- bliss daemon

They claim work from `track_processing_state` and update the shadow pipeline
tables plus compatibility columns.

This is conceptually different from request-triggered tasks: the daemons absorb
newly indexed content and background resets without wrapping every track in a
task row.

## Projector loop

`crate-projector` is the dedicated consumer for the domain-event bus.

It:

- reads Redis Stream events through a consumer group
- retries its own pending messages first after a crash/restart
- decides whether ops or home snapshots need refreshing
- marks processed messages only after warming completes

This is the bridge between write-side mutations and snapshot-driven UI surfaces.

## Media worker bridge

`crate-media-worker` is a Rust service used for download/package work that
should not run inside request handlers. It supports ZIP64 packages, stores
job/progress state in Redis, honors cancel keys, and uses a Redis slot gate via
`CRATE_MEDIA_WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE` so package generation does not saturate the
host. Python code in `app/crate/media_worker.py` and
`app/crate/media_worker_progress.py` adapts it into the existing task/progress
model.

## Import queue

The service loop periodically normalizes external import sources into
`import_queue_items`, which gives the admin UI and ops snapshot a read model for
staging/import state rather than live rescans every time.
