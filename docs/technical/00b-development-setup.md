# Development setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm.
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2.
- Python/uv and Go/Rust only when working directly on those services.
- The repository checkout and its `test-music/` fixture library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate.git
cd crate
npm install
make dev
```

`make dev` is the supported local entry point. It combines
`docker-compose.dev.yaml` and `docker-compose.readplane.dev.yaml`, builds the
backend stack and starts the Vite applications. Do not start only the base dev
compose if the change involves readplane-routed endpoints or SSE.

## Local services

| Surface   | Local port | Normal development hostname         |
| --------- | ---------: | ----------------------------------- |
| Admin     |       5173 | `https://admin.dev.lespedants.org`  |
| Listen    |       5174 | `https://listen.dev.lespedants.org` |
| Docs      |       5175 | `https://docs.dev.cratemusic.app`   |
| Site      |       5176 | `https://www.dev.cratemusic.app`    |
| API       |       8585 | `https://api.dev.lespedants.org`    |
| Readplane |       8686 | `http://localhost:8686`             |

The local backend includes PostgreSQL, cache Redis, durable Redis, `slskd`, API,
readplane, workers for normal/maintenance/analysis/playback work, projector,
media worker and Caddy. The dev fixture has three artists and 122 tracks.

For local TLS and hostnames:

```bash
make dns-setup       # *.crate.local -> 127.0.0.1; requires sudo
make trust-local-ca  # imports Caddy's local CA; macOS helper
```

Those targets are convenience helpers, not portable prerequisites. `make dev`
also advertises project development domains through Caddy; verify the active
Caddyfile and local resolver when cookies or TLS are relevant to your change.

The seeded development account is `admin@cratemusic.app` / `admin`.

## Focused workflows

```bash
make dev-back     # backend, including readplane overlay
make dev-admin    # Admin Vite on 5173
make dev-listen   # Listen Vite on 5174
make dev-docs     # Docs Vite on 5175
make dev-site     # marketing Site Vite on 5176
make dev-logs s=worker
make dev-down
```

The npm workspace includes four web packages: `app/shared/ui`, `app/ui`,
`app/listen` and `app/listen-desktop`. Docs and Site are standalone Vite apps;
their dependencies are installed by `make dev`.

## Federation harness

Federation uses a separate two-node stack so it never shares the normal dev
database or fixture media:

```bash
make federation-dev-up
make federation-dev-smoke
make federation-dev-e2e
make federation-dev-down
```

Node A exposes API/readplane/Admin/Listen on 18585/18686/15173/15174; Node B
uses 28585/28686. There are focused acceptance targets for global catalog,
playback prepare, imports, singleton parity and zero-downtime catalog reads.
Read [Federation overview](federation-overview.md) before changing those flows.

## Tests and migrations

`make dev-test` runs backend checks plus Python, Go, Rust and frontend checks;
it is not a worker-only pytest shortcut. For a narrow Python test use the
project virtual environment or `uv run pytest`; for a full isolated backend run
use `make dev-test-backend`.

Alembic is the authoritative schema path. API/worker startup serializes
`alembic upgrade head` with an advisory lock. Add migrations under
`app/crate/db/migrations/versions/`; do not bootstrap schema changes from a
frontend or an ad-hoc script.

See [Developer guide](developer-guide.md) for ownership boundaries and the
complete repository map.
