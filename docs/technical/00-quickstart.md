# Quickstart — Deploy to Production

Get Crate running on your server in under 5 minutes.

## One-line installer

For a home server or small self-hosted install, use the installer first. It
downloads the home Docker Compose stack, creates `.env` and `config.yaml`,
pulls pre-built GHCR images, and starts Crate.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh | bash
```

It asks only for:

- install directory
- music library path
- access mode
- public or local domain, depending on the mode
- optional Cloudflare DNS token for HTTPS public installs
- initial admin password

Supported access modes:

| Mode         | Use it when                                         | URLs                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `cloudflare` | You have a real domain and want HTTPS via Traefik   | `https://admin.<domain>` |
| `hosts`      | You want a local domain without wildcard DNS        | `http://admin.<domain>`  |
| `dnsmasq`    | You want local wildcard DNS such as `*.crate.local` | `http://admin.<domain>`  |
| `ports`      | You only want direct localhost ports                | `http://localhost:8580`  |

`dnsmasq` mode checks whether dnsmasq is installed and installs/configures it
on supported Linux distros and macOS with Homebrew.

Crate always starts on local ports too:

| URL                                | App             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `http://localhost:8580`            | Admin dashboard |
| `http://localhost:8581`            | Listening app   |
| `http://localhost:8585/api/status` | API health      |

For unattended installs:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ASSUME_YES=1 \
    CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=cloudflare \
    CRATE_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/crate \
    CRATE_MUSIC_DIR=/srv/music \
    CRATE_DOMAIN=example.com \
    CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=cloudflare-token \
    DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me \
    bash
```

Local-domain examples:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=hosts CRATE_DOMAIN=crate.local bash

curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=dnsmasq CRATE_DOMAIN=crate.local bash
```

Use `CRATE_SKIP_START=1` to generate files without starting Docker.

The rest of this page documents the manual production install path.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux server (VPS, home server, NAS — anything that runs Docker)
- Docker and Docker Compose v2 installed
- A directory containing your music library (FLAC, MP3, AAC, OGG, etc.)
- A domain name pointing to your server (for HTTPS via Traefik)

## 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate.git
cd crate
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```bash
# Required
MEDIA_DIR=/path/to/your/media          # Must contain music/ with your library
DOMAIN=your-domain.com                 # Domain for HTTPS certificates
TZ=Europe/Madrid                       # Your timezone
CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-token # Cloudflare API token (for Let's Encrypt DNS challenge)

# Ports (defaults work for most setups)
TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT=80
TRAEFIK_HTTPS_PORT=443
```

## 2. Start the stack

```bash
docker network create crate
docker compose up -d
```

This starts the core stack:

| Service                      | Role                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **traefik**                  | Reverse proxy — automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt        |
| **crate-api**                | FastAPI backend — library indexing, API, streaming       |
| **crate-readplane**          | Go read plane — fast snapshot-backed reads and SSE relay |
| **crate-worker**             | Fast/default background jobs plus service loop           |

### Optional services

These can be started later from the admin dashboard or manually:

| Service        | Role                                                                 | How to enable                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **slskd**      | Soulseek client — peer-to-peer music search and download             | Included in compose, starts automatically. Configure `SLSKD_SLSK_USERNAME` and `SLSKD_SLSK_PASSWORD` in `.env` |
| **proton-vpn** | VPN proxy for the worker — routes Soulseek traffic through ProtonVPN | Set `PROTONVPN_USER` and `PROTONVPN_PASS` in `.env`. Worker uses it as `SCRAPE_PROXY_URL`                      |
| **ollama**     | Local LLM inference — generates EQ presets, genre descriptions       | Add to your compose or point `OLLAMA_URL` to an existing instance. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` in `.env`         |

If you prefer cloud LLMs instead of Ollama, set `LLM_PROVIDER` to `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` (or any litellm-compatible provider) and provide the corresponding API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).

Your services will be available at:

| URL                              | App                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `https://admin.your-domain.com`  | Admin dashboard             |
| `https://listen.your-domain.com` | Listening app               |
| `https://api.your-domain.com`    | API (+ Subsonic at `/rest`) |

## 3. Run the setup wizard

Open `https://admin.your-domain.com` in your browser. On first launch, Crate shows a four-step setup wizard:

### Step 1 — Create Admin Account

Enter your name, email, and password. This is your administrator login.

### Step 2 — API Keys (optional)

Crate enriches your library from multiple external sources. Each key is optional — skip any you don't need and add them later in Settings.

| Service          | What it unlocks                                | Get your key                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Last.fm**      | Artist bios, similar artists, tags, popularity | [last.fm/api](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)             |
| **Ticketmaster** | Upcoming shows for library artists             | [developer.ticketmaster.com](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/) |
| **Spotify**      | Artist images (Client ID + Secret)             | [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)  |
| **Fanart.tv**    | High-quality artist backgrounds                | [fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key/)                    |
| **Setlist.fm**   | Concert setlists and probable setlists         | [api.setlist.fm](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html)      |

### Step 3 — Library Scan

Click "Start Scan". Crate will index every file in your music directory, read tags, and build the library database. This runs in the background — you can start using Crate immediately.

### Step 4 — Done

The admin dashboard shows scan progress and library stats. Once indexing finishes, background enrichment kicks in automatically.

## 4. Start listening

Open `https://listen.your-domain.com` and sign in. This is the listening app — browse your library, play music, use radio, discover with Music Paths, follow artists.

**Android:** Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/releases/latest/download/crate.apk).

**iPhone:** Open the listen URL in Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.

## 5. Subsonic clients

Crate is Subsonic-compatible. Point any client at `https://api.your-domain.com/rest`:

- Symfonium, DSub, Ultrasonic (Android)
- play:Sub (iOS)
- Submariner (macOS)

## What happens automatically

After setup, Crate runs these background tasks on a schedule:

| Task              | Interval       | What it does                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Artist enrichment | 24h            | Bios, photos, similar artists, discographies               |
| Genre indexing    | On new content | Maps tags to curated taxonomy (60+ canonical nodes)        |
| Audio analysis    | Continuous     | BPM, key, loudness, energy, mood, danceability             |
| Bliss vectors     | Continuous     | 20-float acoustic DNA for similarity radio and Music Paths |
| Popularity        | 24h            | Last.fm listeners and playcount                            |
| New releases      | 12h            | MusicBrainz release monitoring                             |
| Shows             | 24h            | Ticketmaster upcoming shows                                |

No manual intervention needed. Check progress at any time in the admin Tasks page.
