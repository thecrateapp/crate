# Library, Storage, Sync, and Imports

## The library as both filesystem and database

Crate's library model has two parallel realities:

- the real files under `/music`
- the normalized representation in PostgreSQL

The sync layer keeps those worlds aligned, while the import/storage layer controls how new files enter the canonical library.

## Configured library root

[app/config.yaml](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/config.yaml) declares:

- `library_path: /music`
- supported audio extensions
- excluded directories
- import sources
- scanner configuration

This file is mounted into API and worker and is the root of several behaviors:

- sync
- watcher
- imports
- scanners
- repair and naming logic

## Storage models

### Legacy layout

Historically, Crate has used human-readable directory structures such as:

- `Artist/Album/Track.flac`
- `Artist/Year/Album/Track.flac`

These are easy to inspect manually but fragile:

- special characters
- leading dots
- rename cascades
- duplicate artist folder variants

### Storage V2

Crate is migrating toward UUID-backed storage paths via [app/crate/storage_layout.py](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/crate/storage_layout.py).

The new shape is conceptually:

- artist directory by `artist.storage_id`
- album directory by `album.storage_id`
- track file name by `track.storage_id`

This makes physical paths opaque and stable, decoupling them from display names.

### Transitional reality

Current Crate supports both:

- legacy name-based folders
- v2 storage-id-based folders

Helpers like `resolve_artist_dir()` and `resolve_album_dir()` exist precisely because the migration is still in progress.

## Sync architecture

[app/crate/library_sync.py](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/crate/library_sync.py) is the core filesystem indexing layer.

### Responsibilities

- walk artist and album directories
- infer canonical artist names
- read tags and media metadata
- upsert artists, albums, and tracks
- detect deletions
- maintain denormalized counters
- skip unnecessary rework when mtimes and track counts suggest no change

### Key design choices

#### Canonical artist grouping

Multiple artist folders can map to one canonical DB artist. This handles cases such as:

- casing differences
- renamed folders
- multi-folder transitional states

#### Album tree support

The sync layer supports both:

- two-level libraries
- three-level `Artist/Year/Album` libraries

#### Mtime short-circuiting

Sync avoids full rescans when:

- stored mtime is recent enough
- track counts still match

This keeps full library sync reasonably cheap on large libraries.

#### FFprobe fallback

When mutagen cannot parse enough info, the sync layer can fall back to `ffprobe` for duration and bitrate.

## Watcher-driven incremental sync

[app/crate/library_watcher.py](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/crate/library_watcher.py) complements full sync with event-driven updates.

Key behaviors:

- only reacts to created or moved files, not every modification
- ignores known photo/cover outputs
- debounces by album directory
- respects processing flags to avoid reacting to worker-owned mutations
- queues `process_new_content` only when newly added content actually needs downstream work

The watcher is intentionally conservative because enrichment and repair themselves can write files.

## Imports and staging

Imports are separate from the canonical library.

[app/config.yaml](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/config.yaml) defines import roots for:

- Tidal
- `tidalrr` (`/music/.imports/tidalrr`)
- Soulseek
- related staging areas

Crate treats these as raw intake zones, not final library destinations.

User uploads and Bandcamp purchase imports use per-task staging under `DATA_DIR`
before anything is moved into `/music`:

- direct uploads stage under `DATA_DIR/uploads`
- Bandcamp purchase archives stage under `DATA_DIR/bandcamp-imports`

Both paths converge on the same worker-owned upload/import routine once the
audio files are available locally.

## Acquisition to library flow

The normal ingestion path is:

1. external download or upload lands in a staging/import area
2. worker normalizes names and structure
3. target artist/album destination is resolved
4. files are moved into the canonical library
5. sync indexes them
6. post-ingest enrichment and analysis are queued
7. cache/domain events refresh affected read models and Listen home sections

The worker acquisition handler in [app/crate/worker_handlers/acquisition.py](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/crate/worker_handlers/acquisition.py) owns a lot of this handoff logic.

## User contributions

Crate's library is shared per instance, but some imports have a clear user
provenance:

- Listen/Admin uploads include `uploader_user_id`.
- Bandcamp imports include the user and Bandcamp item that proved ownership.
- Imported albums are recorded in `library_contributions` with source,
  source_ref, album identity, track entity ids, and metadata.

The Listen library exposes a Contributions surface where a user can:

- see albums they contributed
- download a portable package for a contributed album
- withdraw their contribution

Withdrawal is deliberately conservative. The contribution row is marked
withdrawn first. The worker deletes the album from the shared library only when
no other active contributor remains for that album; otherwise the shared copy is
kept and only that user's provenance is removed.

When a user is deleted, Crate queues contribution cleanup so Bandcamp/imported
content owned only by that user can be removed from the instance.

## Name sanitation and directory resolution

Acquisition code does several important normalization steps:

- sanitize invalid path characters
- strip dangerous leading dots
- choose visible artist folder names over hidden variants
- align staged artist folders with existing library folders when possible

This is especially important for artist names that would otherwise create hidden directories or invalid paths.

## Organizer and repair layer

Beyond sync, Crate contains maintenance tooling for library shape:

- organizer logic
- duplicate detection
- naming checks
- incomplete albums
- mergeable partials
- auto-repair and fix application

The scanner/fixer stack is configured in [app/config.yaml](https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/config.yaml) and implemented across:

- `https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate/blob/main/app/crate/scanners`
- organizer and repair modules
- related worker handlers

These tools let Crate act not just as an indexer, but as an opinionated library maintenance system.

## Storage migration

Storage migration is a first-class background capability:

- `migrate_storage_v2`
- `verify_storage_v2`

These tasks exist because storage-v2 is not merely a new naming pattern. It changes physical identity assumptions across:

- acquisition
- sync
- playback identity
- path-based operations

## Design decisions in this layer

### Why not write directly into final folders from every integration

Because every source has its own quirks:

- Tidal emits temporary/intermediate files
- Soulseek can produce inconsistent folder names
- Bandcamp downloads are user-owned archives that still need normalization
- uploads can contain zip structure surprises

Using staging/import logic gives Crate a place to normalize before the library becomes canonical.

### Why keep sync even with a watcher

The watcher is not enough by itself:

- it can miss events after outages or container restarts
- large restructures are easier to validate with full sync
- mtime-based full sync provides repair and correctness guarantees

The watcher is for freshness. Full sync is for truth reconciliation.

### Why storage-v2 matters

The storage-id model is ultimately about robustness:

- stable paths
- safe handling of weird names
- simpler renames
- cleaner reconciliation between DB identity and filesystem identity
