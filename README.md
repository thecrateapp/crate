---

Crate is a full-stack, self-hosted music system. It watches your filesystem,
syncs/imports user-owned Bandcamp purchases and direct uploads, pulls metadata
from Last.fm / MusicBrainz / Fanart.tv / Setlist.fm / Spotify, analyzes audio
with PANNs + Essentia + bliss-rs, and exposes separate apps on top of a single
FastAPI backend: an **admin** web app for library management and a **Listen**
app (web/PWA/native shells) for playback and discovery. Underneath that, the
backend maintains a snapshot/read-model plane for admin and Listen surfaces.
Every installation is also a federation node: with no peers it is a one-node
network; approved peers extend the same global catalog, taxonomy, human URLs,
playback, imports, user references, and Open Subsonic surface without a mode
switch. Pairing is bilateral, authorization and quotas are owner-side, and the
Go readplane relays remote media without receiving private signing keys.

## Features

**Library management**

- Automatic filesystem scanning and indexing (watchdog + periodic scans)
- Health check and auto-repair pipeline (orphans, stale records, duplicates, naming)
- ID3 tag editor (album-level and per-track) with genre badge picker
- Folder organizer with pattern-based renaming
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Album art manager (6 sources: Cover Art Archive, embedded, Deezer, iTunes, Last.fm, MusicBrainz)
- Manual image upload with crop (cover art, artist photo, background)
- User contribution tracking for uploads and Bandcamp imports, with portable export and withdrawal controls

**Enrichment pipeline**

- **Last.fm** — bio, tags, similar artists, listeners, playcount, upcoming shows (scraper)
- **MusicBrainz** — MBID, discography, country, members, formation dates, URLs
- **Fanart.tv** — artist backgrounds and thumbnails
- **Setlist.fm** — probable concert setlists matched against library tracks
- **Spotify** — popularity score
- **Discogs** — catalog numbers, labels
- **Deezer / iTunes** — artist photos (fallback)

**Audio analysis**

- Hybrid **PANNs CNN14 + Essentia** engine
- PANNs (AudioSet 527 classes): genre-based mood classification (aggressive, dark, electronic, acoustic)
- Essentia: BPM, key, loudness (EBU R128), dynamic range, danceability
- Signal heuristics for tonal moods (happy / sad / valence from key + tempo)
- Batch PANNs inference (~4 tracks at a time)
- `bliss-rs`: 20-float song similarity vectors powering radio mode and smooth transition playlists

**Genre taxonomy**

- 60+ curated genre graph with parent / related / influenced-by / fusion-of edges
- Mix seeding from a single genre expands to musically adjacent genres via BFS traversal
- Alias matching across library tags
- Signed global taxonomy releases with source-provenanced memberships and local overlays

**Federation**

- Node-first global artist, album, track, genre, and user-reference model
- Bilateral signed pairing, typed least-privilege grants, key rotation, replay protection, and strict HTTPS/SSRF policy
- Snapshot plus durable delta catalog synchronization with resumable checkpoints and tombstones
- Stable human routes across local and remote sources (`/artists/high-vis`)
- Owner-side stream tickets, atomic quotas, revocation, Range support, and a benchmark-gated Go byte relay
- Explicit approved imports with signed manifests, disk reservations, hash verification, provenance, and worker-only publication
- Signed opt-in directories, global likes/playlists/radio, opt-in remote scrobbling, and global Open Subsonic IDs

**Acquisition**

- **Bandcamp** — connect a user Bandcamp account, sync collection / wishlist / following, import owned downloadable purchases, persist artist/album Bandcamp links, and dedupe against the shared instance library
- **Tidal** — search and download via `tiddl`, with artifact repair and best-quality-real-output fallback when a provider-labeled lossless download is not actually lossless
- **Soulseek** — progressive search with quality filtering and alternate peer retry via `slskd`
- **Uploads** — users can upload audio files or ZIP archives into the shared library with contributor attribution
- Unified acquisition UI with download queue, concurrency limits (2 slots) and history
- Automatic post-download pipeline: sync → enrich → analyze → artwork

**Listening (Listen app)**

## Quickstart

### Self-hosted install

Fastest path on a Linux/macOS machine with Docker:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh | bash
```

The installer asks for the install directory, music library path, access mode,
and initial admin password. It writes a small self-hosted stack to your machine,
pulls pre-built GHCR images, and starts Crate with Docker Compose.

After installation:

- Admin: `http://localhost:8580`
- Listen: `http://localhost:8581`
- `cloudflare`: public HTTPS at `https://admin.<domain>` and `https://listen.<domain>`
- `hosts`: local HTTP subdomains via `/etc/hosts`
- `dnsmasq`: local HTTP wildcard subdomains, installing dnsmasq if needed
- `ports`: localhost ports only, no domain routing

Advanced/non-interactive example:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ASSUME_YES=1 \
    CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=cloudflare \
    CRATE_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/crate \
    CRATE_MUSIC_DIR=/srv/music \
    CRATE_DOMAIN=example.com \
    CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=cloudflare-token \
    DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me \
    bash
```

Local-domain examples:

```bash
# Explicit entries in /etc/hosts:
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=hosts CRATE_DOMAIN=crate.local bash

# Wildcard local DNS. The installer checks/installs dnsmasq:
curl -fsSL https://cratemusic.app/install.sh \
  | CRATE_ACCESS_MODE=dnsmasq CRATE_DOMAIN=crate.local bash
```

Set `CRATE_SKIP_START=1` if you only want the installer to write
`docker-compose.yaml`, `.env`, and `config.yaml`.

### Local development

Minimum steps to get the full stack running locally from a fresh clone.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and npm (for the Vite dev servers)
- A music folder on disk (or use `test-music/` which ships with 3 artists for dev)

#### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecrateapp/crate.git
cd crate

cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in at least:
#   MEDIA_DIR=./test-music           # or your library path
#   DATA_DIR=./data
#   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
#   LASTFM_APIKEY=<your key>         # https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
#   DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
```

Everything else in `.env` is optional and can be filled in later from the admin Settings page.

#### 2. Start the stack

```bash
make dev
```

This brings up the dev containers (Postgres + Redis + API + Worker + Caddy) and spawns Vite dev servers for both frontends:

- **Admin** — <http://localhost:5173>
- **Listen** — <http://localhost:5174>
- **Docs** — <http://localhost:5175>
- **API** — <http://localhost:8585>

When using the local dev domains through Caddy, the equivalent URLs are:

- **Admin** — <https://admin.dev.lespedants.org>
- **Listen** — <https://listen.dev.lespedants.org>
- **Docs** — <https://docs.dev.cratemusic.app>
- **API** — <https://api.dev.lespedants.org>

#### 3. Log in

Default dev credentials:

```
email:    admin@cratemusic.app
password: admin
```

Change them from **Settings → Users** after first login.

#### 4. Index your library

The filesystem watcher picks up new files automatically. To force a full re-scan:

1. Open the admin UI
2. **Command Palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`)
3. Type _scan_ → **Scan library**

Enrichment (Last.fm / MusicBrainz / audio analysis) runs automatically after the scan.

#### 5. (Optional) Mobile apps

```bash
make cap-ios       # build + run Listen in iOS Simulator
make cap-android   # build + run Listen in Android Emulator
```

Requires Xcode / Android Studio installed locally.

#### Stopping / resetting

```bash
make dev-down        # stop everything
make dev-reset       # stop + wipe Postgres/Redis volumes
make dev-rebuild     # rebuild images and restart
```

## Environment variables

The `.env` file drives both dev and production. Required unless noted.

## Audio analysis pipeline

Crate uses a three-tier hybrid approach:

1. **PANNs CNN14** (primary, x86_64): classifies audio into 527 AudioSet categories. Weighted label groups map to mood dimensions (aggressive, dark, happy, electronic, etc.). Batch inference processes ~4 tracks simultaneously.
2. **Essentia** (signal processing): extracts BPM, musical key, loudness (EBU R128), dynamic range, spectral complexity. Runs on every track.
3. **Heuristics** (fallback): when PANNs is unavailable (ARM / dev), derives mood from signal features (key major/minor for happy/sad, spectral centroid for aggressive, etc.).

The hybrid split uses PANNs for genre-based moods (where it excels) and signal heuristics for tonal moods (where key detection is more reliable than AudioSet labels).

## Bliss song similarity

The `crate-cli` Rust CLI computes a 20-dimensional feature vector per track using [bliss-rs](https://github.com/Polochon-street/bliss-rs). These vectors encode tempo, timbre, loudness, chroma, and spectral characteristics into a compact representation that enables:

- **Artist radio** — find the N most similar tracks to a seed
- **Transition playlists** — order tracks by smooth transitions
- **Cross-artist similarity discovery** — based on actual audio content, not tags
